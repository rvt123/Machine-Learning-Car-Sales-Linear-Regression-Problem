I will be adding some solutions of the  Case Studies on which I have worked and will try to update the solution with many more different approaches and with different techniques so that one can find the difference between different techniques.Every techniques has it's own pros and cons so one should to know to apply each and every technique.
The Dataset on which I have made my models may be same or may vary because i can't share the dataset pertaining to copyright issues but will try to provide similiar Dataset.
